# Python Operations Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of helper functions in Python for performing basic arithmetic operations. The operations include addition, multiplication, and division.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two Python files:

1. `helper.py`: Contains the functions for addition, multiplication, and division.
2. `operate.py`: Imports the functions from `helper.py` and uses them to perform the operations.

### `helper.py`

This file defines the following functions:

- `addition(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `multiplication(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- `hiluk(a, b)`: Returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`.

### `operate.py`

This file is the main script that imports the functions from `helper.py` and uses them. The `main()` function in `operate.py` calls the imported functions and prints the results.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project files.
3. Run the `operate.py` script:

```bash
python operate.py
